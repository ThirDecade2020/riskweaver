RiskWeaver is a Python-based web application built with Streamlit that delivers in-depth cybersecurity risk analysis for a given country. Leveraging GPTâ€‘4 via the OpenAI API, the app lists the top 5 cybersecurity risks based on publicly available data from the country's official cybersecurity agency and other reputable sources. In addition, it provides a concise one-paragraph insight highlighting similarities, differences, or shared patterns among these risks, along with a sidebar of secondary sources for further investigation.
